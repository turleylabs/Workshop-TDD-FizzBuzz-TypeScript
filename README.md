Test-drive a function that converts numbers into strings. But, for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Example results:

```
fizzBuzz(1) = "1"
fizzBuzz(7) = "7"
fizzBuzz(9) = "Fizz"
fizzBuzz(25) = "Buzz"
fizzBuzz(30) = "FizzBuzz"
```
